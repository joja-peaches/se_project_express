# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The WTWR app shows users item cards with clothing itmes as suggestions for what they should wear based on the current weather for their location. This app works with the weather API to accurately gather information for the user, and the images shown are filtered based on the temperature for hot, warm, and cold weather. Users can add more items to the catalog, as well as delte items they may no longer have in their closets. The application also contains a server saving information for multiple users + the item cards in the library.
Tech stack: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express
